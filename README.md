# AI-Powered Music Composer

An AI application that composes original music in the styles of jazz guitar and classical clarinet.

## Description

This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze musical patterns and generate new compositions. It leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on MIDI files of jazz guitar and classical clarinet pieces.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using `music21` to extract notes from MIDI files.
- Neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Music generation and conversion from MIDI to audio formats.
- Interactive user interface with Streamlit.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Music-Composer.git
